## Frontend Configuration

Update your frontend to point to the API:

```javascript
// In your .env or environment config
VITE_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api
```

Or directly in code:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://yourdomain.com/api';
```

## Testing

Without API keys configured, the endpoints return mock data for testing.

Test with curl:
```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/gmb-search.php \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"service":"plumber","location":"Austin TX"}'
```

## Search Tuning

You can speed up large searches and widen results with these `config.php` settings:

- `SERPAPI_THROTTLE_US` (lower = faster, higher = safer vs rate limits)
- `SERPAPI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SEC` / `SERPAPI_TIMEOUT_SEC` (raise for slow networks/large searches)
- `SERPAPI_REQUEST_RETRIES` (retries transient HTTP 0/timeouts before failing over)
- `FILTER_OVERFETCH_MULTIPLIER` (fetch extra results when filters are active)
- `SEARCH_FILL_TARGET_RATIO` (target minimum coverage of requested leads, e.g. `0.95`)
- `SEARCH_QUERY_VARIANT_MAX` (max supplemental query variants for top-up passes)
- `ENABLE_LOCATION_EXPANSION` (auto-expand when results are below the requested limit)
- `LOCATION_EXPANSION_MAX` (how many extra location variants to try)
- `LOCATION_EXPANSION_INCLUDE_STATE` / `LOCATION_EXPANSION_INCLUDE_COUNTRY` (broader coverage)

## Troubleshooting

1. **500 errors**: Check PHP error logs, ensure all files uploaded correctly
2. **CORS errors**: Verify your domain is in ALLOWED_ORIGINS in config.php
3. **Empty results**: Check if API keys are configured (mock data returns if not)
4. **Cache issues**: Delete files in `cache/` directory

## Security Notes

- Keep `config.php` secure - contains API keys
- The `includes/` and `cache/` directories are protected via .htaccess
- Rate limiting is configured but not fully implemented (add Redis for production)
- Consider adding authentication for production use
